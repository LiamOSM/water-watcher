# WaterWatcher
This is a hardware project which measures the flow of water in a bathroom shower and displays the total volume, flow rate, and cost. The device uses a generic hall-effect flow sensor, an Arduino Nano, and several other off-the-shelf components, housed in a custom waterproof 3D-printed enclosure.
Here's a [link to my Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Save-Water-With-the-Shower-Water-Monitor/), where I thoroughly explain how to build this.
