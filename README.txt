# water-watcher
This is a hardware project which measures the flow of water in a bathroom shower and displays the total volume, flow rate, and cost. The device uses a generic hall-effect flow sensor, an Arduino Nano, and several other off-the-shelf components, housed in a custom waterproof 3D-printed enclosure.
